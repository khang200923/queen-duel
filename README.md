# queen-duel
A chess variant with only two queens and an AI.

To play, move the white queen by clicking on a square where it can legally move. Then, the black queen (controlled by the AI) will play what it considers the best move.

Each time a queen moves, it leaves an ❌ on its previous square. No queen can capture or pass through squares marked with ❌.

The objective is to capture the opponent's queen. If a queen has no legal moves left, the other player wins.
